Overview

MidiAssistant is a simple MIDI over ethernet solution for all platforms. It's utilize OSC protocol to communicate between peers. It uses JavaOSC library (http://www.illposed.com/software/javaosc.html).
My motivation is to developing this project that there is no open source solution for MIDI communications over ethernet for different platforms. 
(There are some expensive software solution)

You can run via command line, the parameters following:

java -jar MidiAssistant-<version>.jar

Parameters: 

       list                       List all MIDI port
       name                       Set the name of this host
       remote <host> <port>       The remote host and port where the MIDI messages
                                  is transfered
       ping <milisec>             Ping the remotehost host periodicaly
       midiin <midi port index>   The MIDI port listen in for messages 
       listen <port>              Set a server where the remote clients sends MIDI messages
       midiout <midi port index>  MIDI port where the messages from remote host
                                  is transfered
